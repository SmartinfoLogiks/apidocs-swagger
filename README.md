# apidocs-swagger

Swagger UI based APIDocumentation webportal. Most easy to use and publish APIDocs without the hassle of NodeJS based swagger-ui generation or anything, just create your swagger document on https://editor.swagger.io/, download the swagger json file and add it to docs folder.

> Available with PHP and without PHP modes.

Special thanks to SB Admin 2 Theme, we have used that to setup the great looks of the Portal.

Thank you
